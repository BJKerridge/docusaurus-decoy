- Combat Anomalies – First pilot in the site claims the anomaly. Marauders take priority over other subcaps, and Stormbringers take priority over Marauders. Caps get no priority.
- Data/Relic Anomalies – First pilot in the site claims the anomaly. Once a site is started, it must be completed for it to spawn somewhere else in the region. Pilots caught cherry-picking should be reported to BJK with screenshots.
- Ore Anomalies – Cherry-picking is not allowed in any ore anomaly, due to stopping the site respawning.
- Moon Mining - No more moons, long live Metenox!
