- Combat Anomalies – First pilot in the site claims the anomaly. There are some ratting styles which require specific anomalies - please collaborate.
- Data/Relic Anomalies – First pilot in the site claims the anomaly. Once a site is started, it must be completed for it to spawn somewhere else in the region. Pilots cherry-picking should be reported to BJK with screenshots.
- Ore Anomalies – Cherry-picking is not allowed in any ore anomaly, due to stopping the site respawning.
- Moon Mining - No more moons, long live Metenox! Mining Anomlies are better isk/h and can be compressed via Porpoise.
- Friendlies in our space - Our constellations is PRIVATE, meaning other alliances are not allowed to run any type of site here. If you catch someone not complying, send a screenshot to BJK and ask the pilot to leave.
