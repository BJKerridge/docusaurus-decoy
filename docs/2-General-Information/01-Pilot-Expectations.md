# Pilot Expectations

## Code of Conduct
We expect all pilots in DECOY to live the following values:
- Treat every member of the alliance with respect, regardless of prior capsuleer history in this 20 year old video game
- Be proud to wave the alliance flag
- Be in the Standing Fleet when online
- Be online in Mumble in the Standing Fleet channel whilst on Discord Corp comms
- Have all pilots registered on SEAT
- All pilots have DEATHCLONES in B9-C24 - Phoenix Nest
- All pilots and alts to have hangars ready at all times

## PvE Rules
lt is recommended to focus on Missions and filament sites due to these being instances and non-invasive of other pilots income stream, however:
- Combat Anomalies – First pilot in the site claims the anomaly. Marauders take priority over other subcaps, and Corp Stormbringer ratting takes priority over Marauders. No caps in combat anomalies.
- Data/Relic Anomalies – First pilot in the site claims the anomaly. Once a site is started, it must be completed for it to spawn somewhere else in the region. Pilots caught leaving unfinished sites will be charged 50m. If you cannot finish the site (being hunted, too difficult, not enough time), please report it in the ingame alliance chat or Discord and we will help you complete it.
- Ore Anomalies – Cherry-picking is allowed in any ore anomaly, except Ice Belts, where they must be completed.
- Moon Mining - ALL MOONS WILL BE PUBLIC*.  "Tax" on these moons will be recouped through reprocessing tax or via buyback, and an additional 10% paid by corporations at the end of each month.

## Market Seeding & Buyback
DECOY STONKS is our market seeding and buyback programme. Profits from this are split between the alliance wallet and investors, so active use of the market is heavily encouraged.
However; individuals may seed the market for products at whatever price they decide. You may request additional items to be seeded through Discord if the markup is not acceptable.
Relisting (purchasing items then putting them back on the market) will result in fines to your corporation.
We aim to provide a buyback service for this, including PI Buyback - more information here.
