# Activity Defence Multiplier (ADM)

## What it does
The Activity Defense Multiplier makes a system easier to defend based on activity that happens within it.
- At ADM 1.0x, we have a 18h vulnerability cycle with a 10 minute capture timer
- At ADM 6.0x, we have a 3h vulnerability cycle with a 60 minute capture timer

## How to increase it
ADM is increased by these three counters:
- **Strategic Index:** Increases over time
- **Military Index:** Increases based on number of NPC Kills
- **Industry Index:** Increases based on m3 of ore mined
These counters much reach a level to take effect. You can see your progress towards the level by clicking the system name and navigating to the 'Sovereignty' tab.
Upgrades can be installed once certain Strategic/Military/Industry levels are reached, spawning more PvE sites and belts.
The Military and Industry index decrease by 1% per hour - which will cause system upgrades to go offline.

## Defending IHubs
In order to attack an ihub, a pilot must lock it up and activate an Entosis Link. This will spool up (T1 = 5m, T2 = 2m) and take effect upon its second cycle.
These can be interrupted, by killing, jamming, or bumping the pilot out of range.
If no link is active on an ihub (or command node), they will passively repair in favour of the defender.
