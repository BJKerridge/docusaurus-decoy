# PvE Space

As we are staging and full-time living from Phoenix Coalitions staging system; our PvE areas are as follows:

Pure Blind: https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Pure_Blind/0A-73B/K-QUVW/G8-D09/WMP-OF#const
Fade: https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Fade/VNX-P0#const
Cloud Ring: https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Cloud_Ring/Miennue#const

It is recommended to use only Vexors for Pure Blind, and the rest can be Ishtars/Kronos.
