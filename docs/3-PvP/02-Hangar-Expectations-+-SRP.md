## K7D-II - Iserlohn Fortress
This is a jump clone content deployment to support OnlyFleets. fighting in Delve. I will provide handout mainline ships, but I will require pilots to have their own pods & BLOPS. Pods can be found under the 'Amarr Shuttle' fittings ingame, BLOPS fittings will be coordinated when we perform our move ops.
