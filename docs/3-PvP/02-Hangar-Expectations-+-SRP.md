## B-9C24 - Decoy Doctrines
In addition to the above, DECOY will call its own fleets using the following:
- Leshak
- Machariel

## B-9C24 - Alt / Special Doctrines
To compliment each fleet, it is recommended to bring the following on an alt:
- Tackle Crow
- Sabre
- Bombing Bomber

## R-2R0G - Standing Fleet
It is highly recommended to have a few variations of ships for local defence:
- Cheap MWD Cruiser
- AB ESS Defence ship
- Wormhole rolling Sigil

## SRP
All pinged operations by DECOY in #decoy-pings will recieve SRP.

All pinged operations by Phoenix Co in #important_pings will recieve SRP.

Standing Fleet is NOT SRP'd, so fly ships at your own risk!
