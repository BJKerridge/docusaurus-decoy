# Market & Stonks
DECOY STONKS is our market seeding and buyback programme. Profits are split between the alliance wallet and investors; active use of the market is heavily encouraged.

## Stonks
Decoy Stonks is an investment system to facilitate the alliance buyback and keep our markets seeded.

Pilots may purchase "STONKS" at 1b each (maximum of 50 stonks per person). This isk will be used to acquire minerals and items to store on the market, via buyback or importing.

50% of all the profits generated from market throughput + buyback will be divided across the STONKHOLDERS as isk at the start of each month. Stonks can be purchased and sold back at any time, but only stonks that existed on the 1st of the month count towards the payout, and selling the stonks early exempts you from that months payout.

### Purchasing Stonks
1. Find the corporation DECOY STONKS [5T0NK]
2. Select 'Give Money', send 1b per share you wish to purchase (up to 50b ISK Maximum)
3. You will recieve a Discord message from BJK acknowledging this when he is online

### Withdrawing Stonks
You can withdraw your investment at any time - reach out to `BJK` in a direct message and I'll transfer it back.

### Example Payout:
We have 250 shares (250b in buyback fund).
We stock 150b on the market and 100b as a buffer in the buyback.
We buy 80b from buyback, we end the month with 40b of assets remaining and sell 40b of assets at a 5% markup - 2b profit
1b goes to Alliance wallet
1b gets divided between shareholders, so (1b ÷ 250 shares) 4m is paid out per shareholder
If someone has 50 shares they get 200m
If someone has 2 shares they get 8m

## Buyback
We also provide an alliance buyback service and closely monitor the resources available, giving the alliance a steer on any resource harvesting operations.
Alongside seeding the market, this group will be responsible for having a stockpile to replace the full market amount (buyback from alliance industrialists) plus a T2 BPC cache to facilitate the above.

### Creating a buyback contract:
1. Access the Janice [here](https://janice.e-351.com/).
2. Fill out the form as: Appraisal, Jita 4-4, Buy, Immediate
    1. For Items - move the 'Price Percentage' based on the buyback rates.
    2. For Compressed Ore - click 'Reprocess' and set the 'Ore eff.' rate.
5. Create the contract to the corporation `Decoy Stonks` for the Jita Buy value (adjusted for Compress Ore/Other items).
