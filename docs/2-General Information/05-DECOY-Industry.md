description: Manufacture for the Alliance

We have a list of items we expect on the [public market](https://janice.e-351.com/a/qvZAml) at all times, then based on this, a list of minerals/components we require on the [mineral market](https://janice.e-351.com/a/MWndGr).

For Industry facilities, we are currently using the Phoenix Coalition citadels in B-9C24. There will be new infrastructure in Delve soon!

To keep the items seeded on the market, DECOY will raise a request for items to be manufactured from the team.

DECOY will pay 10% over the value of manufacturing based on purchasing the minerals from the Sotiyo and ME0; so industry pilots will get a profit each time.

Products will be bought back from DECOY Stonks and listed at a healthy non-exportable rate.
