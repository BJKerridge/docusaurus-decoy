The home of DECOY is the Fortizar [R-2R0G - DECOY](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Pure_Blind-Fade-Cloud_Ring/LY-FY6#ihub) in Pure Blind. The rest of this constellation has Astrahus, and all our citadels have compression facilities.

# Phoenix Coalition Home
The home of the Phoenix Coalition is the Keepstar [B-9C24 - Phoenix Nest](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Pure_Blind-Fade-Cloud_Ring/B-9C24#ihub) in Pure Blind. This is the PvP stager where deathclones should be kept.

The coalition does offer [shared space](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Pure_Blind-Fade-Cloud_Ring/0A-73B/K-QUVW/Miennue/G8-D09/WMP-OF/VNX-P0/XG-D1L/6RCQ-V/O-0HW8/6-4V20#adm), where you are free to rat/mine in any of these.

As part of our deathclone deployment to Delve, all Syn IHUB space is considered [shared space](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve-Period_Basis-Querious/W-4U1E/LSC-4P/F-I56R/OK-FEM#ihub) too.
