The home of DECOY is the Fortizar [R-2R0G - DECOY](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Pure_Blind-Fade-Cloud_Ring/LY-FY6#ihub) in Pure Blind. The rest of this constellation has Astrahus, and all our citadels have compression facilities.

![Mercenary Den](03-Mercenary-Den.jpeg)

## Mercenary Dens
These structures attach to Temperate Planets and generate Infomorph Decryption Keys, but slowly reduce the planets workforce, affecting our sovereignty upgrades.

It takes only 10 minutes to anchor a Mercenary Den, but shooting one generates a kill timer in 18~30 hours. For this reason, DECOY has anchored dens on all of our Temperate Planets to prevent hostiles from doing this.

Every 3 days, combat sites spawn across our space triggered by the Mercenary Dens, which can only be triggered by the Mercenary Den Owner. Completing these will **remove the workforce impact** - so DECOY will trigger these and anyone is welcome to run them. There are some fittings for dealing with these sites stored ingame:

`DECOY - Gila Mercenary Den`

`DECOY - Cynabal Mercenary Den`
