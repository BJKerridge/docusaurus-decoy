# Market & Stonks
DECOY STONKS is our market seeding and buyback programme. Profits from this are split between the alliance wallet and investors, so active use of the market is heavily encouraged.
However; individuals may seed the market for products at whatever price they decide. You may request additional items to be seeded through Discord if the markup is not acceptable.

## Stonks
Decoy Stonks is an investment system to facilitate the alliance buyback and keep our markets seeded.
Pilots with capital to invest may purchase "STONKS" at 1b each (maximum of 50 stonks per person).
This isk will be used to acquire raw minerals to be used/seeded, and buy back components from our pilot's for seeding on the market.
50% of all the profits generated from market throughput + buyback will be divided across the STONKHOLDERS as raw isk on the 1st of each month.
Stonks can be purchased and sold back at any time, but only stonks that existed on the 1st of the month count towards the payout, and selling the stonks early exempts you from that months payout.

### Market
DECOY STONKS will be responsible for seeding the market for doctrine & useful ships, as well as raw materials and components close to Jita Buy for industrialists to use.

### Purchasing Stonks
1. Find the corporation DECOY STONKS [5T0NK]
2. Select 'Give Money', send 1b per share you wish to purchase (up to 50b ISK Maximum)
3. You will recieve a Discord message from BJK acknowledging this when he is online

### Example Payout:
We have 250 shares (250b in buyback fund).
We stock 150b on the market and 100b as a buffer in the buyback.
We buy 80b from buyback, we end the month with 40b of assets remaining and sell 40b of assets at a 5% markup - 2b profit
1b goes to Alliance wallet
1b gets divided between shareholders, so (1b รท 250 shares) 4m is paid out per shareholder
If someone has 50 shares they get 200m
If someone has 2 shares they get 8m

## Buyback
We also provide an alliance buyback service and closely monitor the resources available, giving the alliance a steer on any resource harvesting operations.
Alongside seeding the market, this group will be responsible for having a stockpile to replace the full market amount (buyback from alliance industrialists) plus a T2 BPC cache to facilitate the above. Our current rates are:
- 100% Jita Buy - Minerals in the B-9C24
- 100% Jita Buy - PI in B-9C24 or R-2R0G
- 90% Jita Buy (Reprocessed Value) - Compress Ore in B-9C24 or R-2R0G
- 90% Jita Buy (Reprocessed Value) - All other items

### Buying Back Items:
1. Access the Janice [here](https://janice.e-351.com/).
