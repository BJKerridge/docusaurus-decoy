DECOY uses a variety of third-party web-applications and software:

- [SeAT](https://seat.xdecoyx.com/home) is a web-app for tracking in-game activity, along with sync'ing your user account to Discord/Mumble.
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) is software for chats, informal fleet comms, event noficiations and meetings.
- [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/) is VoIP software for organised fleets.
- [Alliance Auth](https://phoenix-coalition.com/) is a web-app used by Phoenix Coalition for Discord & Mumble integration.

### DECOY - SeAT Setup

The first time you access seat, you'll be prompted if you are in DECOY (Choose this one!) or if you're a Blue (used for communicating with other teams).

Registered your account, then link ALL of your pilots (whether they're in DECOY or not) by selecting the cog in the top-right and 'Link Character'.

### DECOY - Discord Setup

Once you've registered your pilots on SeAT, select 'Connector' and 'Identities' on the left, and join the Discord server. If you don't already have an account, you can create one for free at [Discord.gg](https://discord.gg).
