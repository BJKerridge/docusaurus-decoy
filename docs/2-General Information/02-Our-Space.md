# Phoenix Coalition Home
The home of the Phoenix Coalition is the Keepstar [B-9C24 - Phoenix Nest](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Pure_Blind-Fade-Cloud_Ring/B-9C24#ihub) in Pure Blind. This is the PvP stager where deathclones should be kept.

The coalition does offer [shared space](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Pure_Blind-Fade-Cloud_Ring/0A-73B/K-QUVW/Miennue/G8-D09/WMP-OF/VNX-P0/XG-D1L/6RCQ-V/O-0HW8/6-4V20#adm), where you are free to rat/mine in any of these.
