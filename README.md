# DECOY Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

The content and scripts have been modified to suit DECOYs needs. The page can be found hosted [here](https://docs.xdecoyx.com).

## Making Modifications

Content can be modified by forking this repo, changing the markdown files in the docs folder, then creating a pull request to merge this into the main branch. After merging, the website is rebuilt after a few minutes.

Refer to the [markdown format](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) and [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

You can run the server locally in an IDE if you wish to make larger edits. Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) and use the following commands:

`npm i` - Install all the required node modules

`npm start` - Runs the server locally
